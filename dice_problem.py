"""
Which is more likely? 

A) You roll two dice 5 times and, every time, 
one o the two comes up as 1 and the other as 6. 

B) You roll 10 dice all at once. 
5 come up as 1s and the other 5 come up as 6s.

A, B or equal probability?

Below program creates a handful of 2 dice and throws them five times 
and a handful of 10 dice and throws them once. 

Results are converted to a numpy array, sorted and checked against the 'win' array.

Above is repeated by number specified by NUM_TESTS.
